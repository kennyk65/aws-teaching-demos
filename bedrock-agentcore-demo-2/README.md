## Bedrock AgentCore Demo ü§ñ

This demo establishes a very simple Agent using **Bedrock AgentCore**. It shows the steps to create and deploy a basic ‚Äúhello world‚Äù agent, and demonstrates the **CloudWatch GenAI Observability** feature for AgentCore.

---

### Prerequisite

You will need:

* **Python** installed (3.12 or greater).
* The **AWS SDK**.
* The **agentcore CLI**, installed by running `pip install amazon-bedrock-agentcore-cli`.
* An IDE like **VSCode** works best, but is not required.
* Enable CloudWatch Signal Spans: Go to the console for **X-Ray settings** at [CloudWatch Transaction Search settings (us-west-2)](https://us-west-2.console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/home?region=us-west-2#xray:settings/transaction-search) (us-west-2 assumed). 
    * Currently, there is no command-line equivalent: find **‚ÄòTransaction Search‚Äô**, click **edit**, and **enable** it. Give this a few minutes. *(TODO - FIND CLI EQUIVALENT WHEN AVAILABLE)*

---

### Setup

1.  Clone / Copy `https://github.com/kennyk65/aws-teaching-demos`.
2.  `CD` into the `/bedrock-agentcore-demo-basic` folder.

Run the following from this folder to set everything up:

```bash
aws cloudformation deploy --stack-name agentcore-demo --template-file agentcore-demo.yml --capabilities CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM

for /f "delims=" %i in ('aws cloudformation describe-stacks --stack-name agentcore-demo --query "Stacks[0].Outputs[?OutputKey=='RoleArn'] | [0].OutputValue" --output text') do set ROLE_ARN=%i

for /f "delims=" %i in ('aws cloudformation describe-stacks --stack-name agentcore-demo --query "Stacks[0].Outputs[?OutputKey=='RepositoryUri'] | [0].OutputValue" --output text') do set REPO_URI=%i
```

* This establishes the Role, ECR repository, and environment variables needed later.

---

### Demo
Assuming you are still in the same folder as before, run these commands one at a time. See the comments for explanation on what each is doing:


```
# This establishes a new agent in AgentCore.
# The name and source file are given, as well as the execution role and
# ECR repository to use. However, it does not actually build / start the agent.
agentcore configure -n agentcore_demo -e my_agent.py --execution-role %ROLE_ARN% --ecr %REPO_URI% --requirements-file requirements.txt

# This simple command:
# - builds a Docker container (using CodeBuild),
# - pushes an image to our ECR repository,
# - launches the agent,
# - creates an endpoint:
agentcore launch


# Next, run this command a few times to invoke the agent:
agentcore invoke '{"prompt":"world"}'
agentcore invoke '{"prompt":"world"}'
agentcore invoke '{"prompt":"world"}'
agentcore invoke '{"prompt":"world"}'
```

* Open the management console to see the agent running: https://us-west-2.console.aws.amazon.com/bedrock-agentcore/agents (assuming you are running in us-west-2).

* **Observability:** Open the CloudWatch GenAI Observability link: https://us-west-2.console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/home?region=us-west-2#/gen-ai-observability/model-invocation

---

### Cleanup
Assuming you are still in the same folder as before, run these commands:

```
agentcore destroy -a agentcore_demo --force

aws cloudformation delete-stack --stack-name agentcore-demo
```

* **IMPORTANT!! ‚ö†Ô∏è EXPENSIVE!!! ‚ö†Ô∏è** Disable CloudWatch Signal Spans:
    * Go to the console for X-Ray settings at https://us-west-2.console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/home?region=us-west-2#xray:settings/transaction-search (us-west-2 assumed). 
    * Find ‚ÄòTransaction Search‚Äô, click edit, and disable it. Give this a few minutes. (TODO - FIND CLI EQUIVALENT WHEN AVAILABLE)
