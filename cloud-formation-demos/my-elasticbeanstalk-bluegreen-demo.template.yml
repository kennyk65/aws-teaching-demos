AWSTemplateFormatVersion: 2010-09-09

# This CloudFormation template sets up a demonstration of a BlueGreen deployment.
# It sets up two ElasticBeanstalk environments:
# The "blue" environment is associated with the "production" URL and is running the older 'v1-blue' version.
# The "greeb" environment is associated with the "staging" URL and is running the newer 'v2-green' version.
# Use ElasticBeanstalk's environment swap feature to do the 'deploy'

    Description: Unique prefix of the production environment
    Type: String
    Default: kk-production

  PrefixStaging:
    Description: Unique prefix of the staging environment
    Type: String
    Default: kk-staging

  S3Bucket:
    Description: Bucket containing the existing WAR files.  
    Type: String
    Default: kk-uploads-oregon

  S3ObjectBlue:
    Description: Object key (optional prefix) of the existing BLUE WAR file in the S3 bucket
