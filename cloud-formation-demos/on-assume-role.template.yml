# Set up an EventBridge rule which captures all AssumeRole API calls on this account, except for those made by AWS services.  
# Trigger a Lambda when this happens.  Have it digest the event information and format a readable message.
# Use SNS to eMail this message to a given eMail address.
# Note:  RUN ON US-EAST-1 ONLY - This template will execute in any region, but AssumeRole events occur in us-east-1 only.

Parameters:
  EmailAddress:
    Description: Eamail address to send approval notifications to
    Type: String
