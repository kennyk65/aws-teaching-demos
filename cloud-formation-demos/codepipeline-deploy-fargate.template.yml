# This is a  codepipeline demo that 
# 1) grabs code from GitHub on change 
# 2) packages and tests using paralell actions 
# 3) Docker-izes it, and stores in ECR
# 4) deploy to a FARGATE ECS Cluster

# TO RUN THIS:  You'll need a GitHub Repository, and a GitHub OAuthToken.
# To make a GitHub OAuthToken, go to GitHub / Settings / Personal Access Tokens
# The default value you see here will work only if you prepend it with a '0'.
# You will also need a working ECS Cluster.  Create one with "base-ecs-cluster.template.yml" if you need one.
# You will also need an ECR registry containing the image you want to deploy, at least the initial copy of it.  This will be updated by the pipeline.
#  This article helped immensely:  https://www.prodops.io/blog/deploying-fargate-services-using-cloudformation

  AWS::CloudFormation::Interface:
    ParameterGroups:
      - Label:
          default: The location of source code
        Parameters:
          - GitHubRepository
          - GitHubOAuthToken
      - Label:
          default: Target ECS Cluster
        Parameters:
          - DockerRepositoryPrefix
          - DockerImage
          - ECSCluster
          - ClusterType
          - ContainerName
      - Label:
          default: Other
        Parameters:
          - CodePipelineBucketPrefix
          - VpcId
          - SubnetIds

Parameters:
  GitHubRepository:
    Type: String
    Default:  kennyk65/aws-cloudbuild-demo/master
    Description:  The owner / repository / branch that you want to pull from.

  GitHubOAuthToken:
    Type: String
    Default:  b45b4b39fe35179592ceb5259c481b05a0eb27d
    Description:  CodePipeline sources require an OAuthToken, even if they are public.  To make one go to GitHub / Settings / Personal Access Tokens 

  ECSCluster:
    Description:  The ECS Cluster that is ready to run our service / task definition.
    Type: String    
    Default: default

  DockerRepositoryPrefix:
    Description:  The prefix of the existing private ECR repository.  You'll have to create one and initially push to it the docker image that you want to demo.  CodeBuild will push an updated Docker image here when built.  Check that Region and account number.
    Type: String
    Default: 011673140073.dkr.ecr.us-west-2.amazonaws.com

  DockerImage:
    Description:  The docker image name, no prefix, no tag. You'll have to create one and initially push to it the docker image that you want to demo.  CodeBuild will push an updated Docker image here when built.  Check that Region and account number.
    Type: String
    Default: spring-cloud-aws-environment-demo

  ContainerName:
    Description:  The label of the container as seen on the task definition that will be created.  Just used to visually identify your container later.  I usually make mine based on the Docker image name.
    Type: String
    Default:  spring-cloud-aws-environment-demo

  ClusterType:
    Description:  Do you want to deploy to a standard ECS cluster or Fargate cluster?  Fargate is easier, but more expensive.
    Type: String
    Default: Fargate
    AllowedValues:
      - ECS
      - Fargate

  CodePipelineBucketPrefix:
    Description: CodePipeline needs a utility bucket for its internal use.  Specify the prefix for the bucket name.  You'll probably need to clean this out later to delete the stack.
    Type: String
    Default: codepipeline-kk-

  VpcId:
    Type: AWS::EC2::VPC::Id
    Description: Select the VPC that you want to access the running containers through.

  SubnetIds:
    Type: List<AWS::EC2::Subnet::Id>
    Description: Select 1-2 public subnets in your VPC where you want the resulting containers to be accessible from.
