# This is a simple codepipeline demo that does very little beyond what the CodeBuild demo did.
# It is a bit more complex with codepipeline involved, but ultimately more flexible too.

# TO RUN THIS:  You'll need a GitHub Repository, and a GitHub OAuthToken.
# To make a GitHub OAuthToken, go to GitHub / Settings / Personal Access Tokens
# Put a '0' on the front of the value you see here.


Parameters:
  CodePipelineBucketPrefix:
    Description: CodePipeline needs a utility bucket for its internal use.  Specify the prefix for the bucket name
    Type: String
    Default: codepipeline-kk-

  GitHubRepository:
    Type: String
    Default:  kennyk65/aws-cloudbuild-demo/master
    Description:  The owner / repository / branch that you want to pull from.

  GitHubOAuthToken:
    Type: String
    Default:  b45b4b39fe35179592ceb5259c481b05a0eb27d
    Description:  CodePipeline sources require an OAuthToken, even if they are public.  To make one go to GitHub / Settings / Personal Access Tokens 

  OutputS3BucketAndPrefix:
    Description: Existing S3 Bucket (and optional folder/prefix) where you want to place output artifacts
    Type: String
    Default: kk-uploads-oregon/build-output
