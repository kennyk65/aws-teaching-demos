AWSTemplateFormatVersion: 2010-09-09

# This CloudFormation template demonstrates responding to a cloudwatch event.
# Specifically it detects whenever an assumerole call is made, and sends a notification.
# This template requires that you are running in us-east-1 to detect this particular event.
# TODO: The notification is quite raw, the original JSON.  Maybe call a lambda to make a clean message.
# TODO: AssumeRole happens quite a bit for innocent reasons.  Perhaps focus on a specific role.

Parameters:

  EmailAddress:
    Description: Email address to send alerts to.  Alerts will be sent whenever someone or something at AWS accesses your account.
    Type: String
    Default: xxxxxx@gmail.com
