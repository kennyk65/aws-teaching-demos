AWSTemplateFormatVersion: 2010-09-09

# This is a  codepipeline demo that 
# 1) grabs code from GitHub on change 
# 2) packages and tests using paralell actions 
# 3) sends a manual approval to the email of your choice, to which you must respond 
# 4) deploy to ElasticBeanstalk.

# TO RUN THIS:  You'll need a GitHub Repository, and a GitHub OAuthToken.
# To make a GitHub OAuthToken, go to GitHub / Settings / Personal Access Tokens
# The default value you see here will work only if you prepend it with a '0'.
