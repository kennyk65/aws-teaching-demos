# This is a  codepipeline demo that 
# 1) grabs code from GitHub on change 
# 2) packages and tests using parallel actions 
# 3) Docker-izes it, and stores in ECR
# 4) deploys it to ElasticBeanstalk

# TO RUN THIS:  You'll need a GitHub Repository, and a GitHub OAuthToken.
# To make a GitHub OAuthToken, go to GitHub / Settings / Personal Access Tokens
# The default value you see here will work only if you prepend it with a 'g'.
# You will also need an ECR registry containing the image you want to deploy, at least the initial copy of it.  This will be updated by the pipeline.

Metadata:
  # Controlling the order of the parameters on the CloudFormation page;
  AWS::CloudFormation::Interface:
    ParameterGroups:
      - Label:
          default: The location of source code
        Parameters:
          - GitHubRepository
          - GitHubOAuthToken
      - Label:
          default: Docker Image
        Parameters:
          - DockerRepositoryPrefix
          - DockerImageName
      - Label:
          default: Other
        Parameters:
          - CodePipelineBucketPrefix

Parameters:
  GitHubRepository:
    Type: String
    Default:  kennyk65/aws-cloudbuild-demo/master
    Description:  The owner / repository / branch that you want to pull from.

  GitHubOAuthToken:
    Type: String
    Default:  hp_qE7Ufaq01ypwGYFBTLKFZilbDMHsXr3MnCXx     # put a g in front
    Description:  CodePipeline sources require an OAuthToken, even if they are public.  To make one go to GitHub / Settings / Personal Access Tokens.  Or put a 'g' in front of this one. 

  DockerRepositoryPrefix:
    Description:  The name of the existing ECR repository, no image, no tag.  You'll have to create one and initially push to it the docker image that you want to demo.  CodeBuild will push an updated Docker image here when built.  Check that Region and account number.
    Type: String
    Default: 011673140073.dkr.ecr.us-west-2.amazonaws.com

  DockerImageName:
    Description:  The name of the docker container imaage, no tag suffixes.  
    Type: String
    Default:  spring-cloud-aws-environment-demo

  CodePipelineBucketPrefix:
    Description: CodePipeline needs a utility bucket for its internal use.  Specify the prefix for the bucket name.  You'll probably need to clean this out later to delete the stack.
    Type: String
    Default: codepipeline-kk-
