# CodeBuild demo.  Demonstrates building with Java/Maven, creating image, pushing to ECR
# Source needs to come from a public github repo of your choice.  
# Buildspec from that repository will be ignored in place of what is here.
# The build is using Java, but this could be adjusted to other languages.
# Much of the work involves setup of the role / policy, so you have to allow this when you run.
# On delete, there was no (easy) way to clear out the ECR repository, so do this manually.
