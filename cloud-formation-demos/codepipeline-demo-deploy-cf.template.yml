# This codepipeline demo:
#  1) Grabs source from GitHub whenever it changes
#  2) builds and unit tests in parallel.
#  3) Deploys using CloudFormation

# TO RUN THIS:  You'll need a GitHub Repository, and a GitHub OAuthToken.
# To make a GitHub OAuthToken, go to GitHub / Settings / Personal Access Tokens
# The default value you see here will work only if you prepend it with a 'g'.

# TODO: PRESENTLY NOT WORKING.  HAVING DIFFICULTY PASSING PARAMETERS FROM BUILD STAGE TO DEPLOYMENT.
