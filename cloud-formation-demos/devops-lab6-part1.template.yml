#  Rough approximation of AWS DevOps Lab 5 - Deploying the MadLibs application as 3 container-based apps running in ECS behind a load balancer.
#  Pretty cool when done, and a lot better than the original lab instructions.
#  Instructions:  
#    1.  Run this 'base' template.  It establishes roles, policies, security group, and ALB,  Use any VPC you like, default is fine.
#    2.  See the accompanying "2-services" template.  Follow the instructions within, running it three times to establish the three services.
#    3.  Be sure to delete the services when done, each runs in Fargate generating Fargate costs.  Delete this when done because of the ALB charges.


Parameters:

  CodePipelineBucketPrefix:
    Description: CodePipeline needs a utility bucket for its internal use.  Specify the prefix for the bucket name.  
    Type: String
    Default: codepipeline-kk-

  ECSCluster:
    Description:  The ECS Cluster that is ready to run our service / task definition.
    Type: String    
    Default: default

  VPC:
    Type: AWS::EC2::VPC::Id
    Description: Select a VPC, one with public subnets

  SubnetIds:
    Type: List<AWS::EC2::Subnet::Id>
    Description: Select 1-2 subnets in your selected VPC, private preferred if NATting is setup.  Fargate ENIs will connect here.
