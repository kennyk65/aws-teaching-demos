    "This task demonstrates core Strands Agents concepts through practical implementation, showing how each feature builds upon its predecessors to create a comprehensive financial advisory system. By the end, you will have production-ready agents capable of providing personalized budgeting advice, spending analysis, and financial recommendations.\n",

    "- **Personalized Financial Guidance**: Tailored advice based on income and spending patterns\n",
    "- **Interactive Budgeting**: Real-time budget calculations using the proven 50/30/20 rule\n",
    "- **Visual Analytics**: Chart generation for better financial data comprehension\n",
    "- **Conversation Memory**: Context retention across multiple interactions for personalized experiences\n",
    "- **Structured Reporting**: Consistent, parseable financial reports with health scores and recommendations\n",
    "- **Responsible AI**: Built-in guardrails and disclaimers for ethical financial advice\n",

This is the default conversation manager used by the Agent class and is ideal for most applications where recent context is most important.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **[NullConversationManager](https://strandsagents.com/latest/documentation/docs/api-reference/agent/#strands.agent.conversation_manager.null_conversation_manager.NullConversationManager)**: A simple implementation that does not modify the conversation history. It's useful for short conversations that won't exceed context limits, debugging purposes, or cases where you want to manage context manually.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **[SummarizingConversationManager](https://strandsagents.com/latest/documentation/docs/api-reference/agent/#strands.agent.conversation_manager.summarizing_conversation_manager.SummarizingConversationManager)**: Implements intelligent conversation context management by summarizing older messages instead of simply discarding them. This approach preserves important information while staying within context limits, making it ideal for long-running conversations where historical context matters."

    "### Task 1.5: Add Structured Output for Financial Reports\n",
    "\n",
    "**What is Structured Output?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Structured output ensures that AI agents return data in a consistent, predictable format that your application can reliably parse and use. Instead of receiving free-form text responses that vary in structure, you get data that conforms to a predefined schema.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why Use Pydantic?**\n",
    "\n",
    "[Pydantic](https://docs.pydantic.dev/) is a Python library for data validation and schema definition. It allows you to:\n",
    "- Define the exact structure of data you expect (fields, types, constraints)\n",
    "- Automatically validate that data matches your schema\n",
    "- Get helpful error messages when data doesn't match\n",
    "- Add descriptions and constraints (e.g., \"score must be between 1-10\")\n",
    "\n",
    "**How Strands Uses Pydantic:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The Strands Agent SDK provides a `structured_output()` method that:\n",
    "1. Takes your Pydantic model as a schema definition\n",
    "2. Instructs the LLM to generate output matching that exact structure\n",
    "3. Validates and parses the LLM's response into a Python object\n",
    "4. Returns a type-safe object you can use in your code\n",
    "\n",
    "This is particularly useful for financial applications where you need consistent data formats for calculations, reporting, and integration with other systems."
